Data was scraped from the GitHub API by filtering users in Banglore with over 100 followers and fetching their most recent repositories using the requests library of Python.
A significant portion of repositories in Banglore are written in JavaScript but surprisingly Python is also seen in many repositories.
Developers in Bangalore should focus on collaboration in JavaScript-based and Python-based projects to leverage the local expertise and community.
The code used to scrape the users and repositories is written in fetch.py
The analysis of the data using Pandas library is written in the TDS_P1(1).ipynb notebook.
